# Federated Learning Example

This code demonstrates how to implement a simple federated learning task using TensorFlow Federated (TFF). The code trains a simple model on federated data using the Federated Averaging algorithm.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or later
- TensorFlow Federated (TFF) 0.18 or later
- TensorFlow 2.5 or later

## Usage

1. Install the required dependencies using pip:
pip install tensorflow tensorflow-federated

2. Run the `federated_learning.py` script:
python federated_learning.py


The script will train the model for 10 rounds of Federated Averaging on synthetic federated data. During each round, the script will print the loss of the model.

## Implementation

The `federated_learning.py` script performs the following tasks:

1. Creates a simple model using Keras.
2. Generates federated training data using the TFF synthetic data generator.
3. Wraps the data in a TFF federated dataset.
4. Defines the Federated Averaging process using TFF.
5. Runs the Federated Averaging process for 10 rounds of training.

The code is well-commented and should be easy to understand even if you're new to federated learning or TFF.

## Acknowledgments

This code is based on the federated learning example in the TensorFlow Federated documentation. The synthetic data generator is also provided by TFF.
