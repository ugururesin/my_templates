'''
This code defines a simple neural network with a single hidden layer and trains it using the SARSA algorithm
to predict the Q-values for each state-action pair.
The model is updated by fitting it to the target Q-value calculated using the reward
and the predicted Q-values for the next state and action.
The process is then repeated for a number of episodes until convergence.
