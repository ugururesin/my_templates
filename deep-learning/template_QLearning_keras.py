'''
This code defines a simple neural network with a single hidden layer and trains it
using the Q-learning algorithm to predict the Q-values for each state-action pair.

The model is updated by fitting it to the target Q-value calculated
using the reward and the maximum predicted Q-value for the next state.

The process is then repeated for a number of episodes until convergence.
